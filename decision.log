# Decision log

## Tech used:

- Python
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- React, JS, HTML, CSS


## Why I used them:

- I chosed python as the programming language, because this is the most important for you and because this is what I ahve the most experience with.
- FastAPI was chosed, because it is fast and is more suitable with database queries than Flask for example.
- I chosed PostgreSQL as my database, sicne this is what I am most familiar with and it is a good fit for the project.
- Docker is a no brainer when it coems to containerization.
- React, JS, HTML, CSS were chosed, because I wanted to use a modern and popular frontend framework and react is a very good choice for this.


## Project choice

The reason I choosed to solve the task - which is to visualize the stock trends -
is it was interesting to me and it has a lot of data to work with and therefore a lot of potential for future improvements.

You are able to improve it by displaying and analyzing different valeu of a single stock, or multiple stocks.
Also it is easy to integrate Forex, Crypto, or any other asset.

First I wanted to work with coffee data, but I quickly realized that it is not a good fit for this project and has less data than stock data.
